# Purpose
Driver.js is a nice and easy to use library for highlighted showcase tour. The only cumbersome use case for me was handling steps on dynamically created elements. There is an issue, where multiple driver solution was proposed. So, I've used that one, and created this wrapper to handle edge cases (mostly) by plugin.
