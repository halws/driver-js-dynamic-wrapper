# Purpose
Driver.js is a nice and easy to use library for highlighted showcase tour. The only cumbersome use case for me was handling steps on dynamically created elements. There is an [issue](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/driver.js/issues/162), where multiple driver solution was proposed. So, I've used that one, and created this wrapper to handle edge cases (mostly) by plugin.
